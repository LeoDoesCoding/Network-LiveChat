# Network-LiveChat
Establishing sockets code from Nicholas Day. Remaining code is original.

## Currently present:
 - Establishes server/client(s) connection.
 - Client(s) can send messages to server.
 - Client(s) can recieve messages from other clients (through server).
 - If client enters "end", the connection is terminated for all clients.
 - Connection error checking and feedback.
 
## Todo:
 - Fix issue: Sort how messages of size 200+ are sent.
 - Remove message clipping.
 - Try elimination of client code OR add GUI.
 - Testing.
