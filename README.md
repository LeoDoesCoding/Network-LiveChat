# Network-LiveChat
## Currently present:
 - Server/client connection when both applications are running.
 - Client can send messages to server, which are then sent back.
     - This is done with threads, in preparation for multiple clients but is not yet equipped to handle multiple clients.
 - If client enters "end", the connection is terminated.
 - Connection error checking and feedback.
 
## Todo:
 - GUI.
 - Multiple client connections.
 - Testing.
