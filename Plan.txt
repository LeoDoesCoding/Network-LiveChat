TODO:
 - Issue: server is ignoring second(+) client.
	A connection seems to be made (ie, when "end" is entered by first client, it ends it for the second) but the second client is never aknowleged by the server. It does not recieve chat nor can enter any.
 - GUI?


Multiple users:
 on recieveMessage: new thread(function for each user. Pass in the socket for each one).
 When recieve message, send display for each socket user.
 - When a user enters "end", delete them from the connections list. IF no clients connected, disconnect srever too.


Remove need for client?? (ie, everythin handled by serve)
